Welcome to Bud for Brains — a personalized strain discovery and education platform.

This isn’t just another AI chatbot. It’s the result of my time spent working the frontlines as a budtender — guiding patients and customers who often didn’t know what to ask or where to start.  
That experience stuck with me, even after I left the industry. I knew there had to be a better, more informed, and more supportive way to help people explore cannabis confidently.

### How to Use This App:
- 🔍 **Explore:** Filter strains by effects, terpene, or type  
- 🧠 **Chat:** Ask questions like *“What does limonene do?”* or *“What strain is good for sleep?”*  
- 🧾 **Survey:** Build a user profile so the assistant knows what matters to you  
- 📓 **Journal:** Track your own reactions to strains so you can remember what worked  
- 📘 **About:** Learn how it all works and why I built it

This project means a lot to me. I built it to prove what’s possible when passion, data science, and real experience come together.
